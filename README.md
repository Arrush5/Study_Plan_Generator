# 📘 AI Study Plan Generator & Tracker

## 🔍 Project Overview
The **AI Study Plan Generator & Tracker** is a web-based application that helps users create a personalized study plan based on their learning goal, available time, and study preferences.  
The system not only generates a structured plan but also allows users to **track daily progress**, visualize completion status, and adjust study behavior over time.

The project focuses on **planning, execution, and tracking**, rather than skill assessment or testing.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Generate realistic, goal-oriented study plans
- Support different learning intents:
  - Exam preparation
  - Skill / topic completion
  - Certification preparation
- Track daily task completion
- Provide progress insights and weekly milestone tracking
- Ensure reliability using AI with a rule-based fallback mechanism

## 🧠 AI Integration Strategy

### Primary Planner
- Uses **Hugging Face Inference Providers (Router API)** with an instruction-tuned chat model
- Generates **topic-specific weekly milestones and subtopics**
- Suitable for both exam-oriented and skill-oriented goals

### Fallback Planner
- If AI is unavailable (API error, quota, model issue), the system automatically switches to a **rule-based planner**
- The fallback planner:
  - Adapts to goal type
  - Avoids exam-specific patterns (e.g., PYQs) for skill-based learning
  - Guarantees uninterrupted plan generation

This hybrid approach ensures **reliability, explainability, and robustness**.

## 🧩 Plan Generation Logic
1. User provides:
   - Goal / subject
   - Goal type
   - Duration
   - Weekly availability
   - Study intensity and preferences
2. AI (or fallback) generates:
   - Weekly milestones
   - Topic-specific subtopics
3. System converts weekly structure into:
   - Daily tasks
   - Learn → Practice → Revise / Improve pattern
4. A dynamic revision window is applied:
   - ~10% of total duration
   - Minimum 2 days, maximum 14 days

---

## 📊 Progress Tracking Mechanism
- Each task has a status: `pending` or `done`
- Progress percentage: (Completed Tasks / Total Tasks) × 100
- Weekly progress is calculated independently
- Visual indicators:
- Progress bar
- Weekly completion bars
- Completion badges for fully completed weeks

## 👤 Sample User Journey
1. User enters goal: *“Python for Data Science”*
2. Selects goal type: *Skill / Topic Completion*
3. Chooses duration and weekly availability
4. System generates a structured plan
5. User completes daily tasks
6. Dashboard updates progress and milestones
7. Full plan can be reviewed anytime in the **Full Plan** tab

---

## 📌 Notes
- The application supports **one active plan at a time** for simplicity and clarity
- SQLite storage is sufficient for demos and academic evaluation
- The architecture is extensible for multi-user or persistent storage if required
